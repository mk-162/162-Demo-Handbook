## Strategic Challenges

### 1. Platform Dependency
- **Risk:** ~70% of UK sales through Amazon
- **Problem:** Amazon owns the customer relationship
- **Impact:** Algorithm changes or policy shifts could devastate sales
- **Mitigation:** Convert Amazon buyers to direct accounts

### 2. Brand Recognition Post-Rebrand
- **Risk:** Gocableties had recognition; GTSE is newer
- **Problem:** Transition period means split brand equity
- **Impact:** SEO and customer recall affected
- **Mitigation:** Strong "Built for Business" positioning

### 3. Commoditization Pressure
- **Risk:** Cable ties seen as interchangeable commodity
- **Problem:** Price becomes only differentiator
- **Impact:** Margin erosion, race to bottom
- **Mitigation:** Specialist positioning, technical expertise, service differentiation

### 4. Geographic Expansion Complexity
- **Risk:** US market requires different approach
- **Strength:** Jason Burton (13 years industry experience) leading NA
- **Opportunity:** US buyers want trade support (Net-30, bulk quotes)
- **Challenge:** Local competition (Grainger, Uline) well established
