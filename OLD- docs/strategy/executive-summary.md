## Our Journey

GTSE began in 2011 when Freddie Miller, returning from PwC Hong Kong, founded Gocableties. Over a decade of growth transformed the business from a cable tie specialist into a comprehensive trade supplies company. The 2021 rebrand to **GTSE (Global Trade Supplies Exchange)** signaled our evolution—same family values, broader vision.

Today we serve thousands of trade customers daily across construction, electrical, automotive, oil & gas, aviation, medical, marine, agricultural, and audio-visual industries.

## Core Business

### Primary Products
- **Cable Ties** - Our foundation. All sizes, materials, and tensile strengths:
  - Standard nylon (various ratings)
  - Heavy duty (114kg/251lb tensile strength)
  - Stainless steel (160kg/352lb tensile strength)
  - Reusable/releasable
  - Biodegradable
  - UV resistant for outdoor use

### Extended Range
- Tape (electrical, duct, specialty)
- Heat shrink tubing
- Cable management accessories
- Wire connectors
- Hose protectors (Epha brand)
- Tree Pro Products

## Competitive Position

### The Market
We operate in the B2B industrial supplies space, competing with:

| Competitor | Type | GTSE Advantage |
|------------|------|----------------|
| **RS Components** | Major distributor | Better pricing on core products, faster trade setup |
| **Screwfix** | Trade retailer | Deeper cable tie range, proper B2B terms |
| **BRADY** | Industrial specialist | Broader product range, competitive pricing |
| **Grainger** | Industrial distributor | UK-based support, no minimum orders |
| **Amazon** | Marketplace | Expertise, trade accounts, human support |

### Our Sweet Spot
We sit between:
- **The big distributors** (RS, Grainger) - too impersonal, slow trade setup
- **The trade retailers** (Screwfix) - limited range, no real B2B terms
- **Amazon** - no expertise, no relationships, no credit terms

**GTSE delivers:** Professional-grade products + trade-focused service + family business relationships.

## Key Priorities (12-24 Months)

### 1. Brand Consolidation Post-Rebrand
- **Goal:** Establish GTSE as the recognized brand (transition from Gocableties complete)
- **Tagline:** "Built for Business"
- **Voice:** Professional, trade-focused, family business ethos with global reach

### 2. Channel Optimization

| Channel | Current State | Focus |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Amazon UK** | Strong presence | Protect & optimize; Amazon is a cash cow but we don't own the customer |
| **Amazon US** | Growing | Aggressive expansion; Jason Burton (13 years industry) leading NA |
| **gtse.co.uk** | Core B2B | Convert Amazon buyers to direct; improve margins |
| **gtsegroup.com** | US wholesale | B2B growth; Net-30 terms, bulk quotes |

### 3. B2B Deepening
- Trade credit accounts (30-day terms)
- PO ordering on account
- Dedicated account management for larger customers
- Technical support for product selection
- Free delivery: £75 UK, $500 US

### 4. Amazon Excellence
- Protect the revenue engine
- Optimize listings with real specs (tensile strengths, materials)
- Leverage Amazon Business B2B features
- Use Amazon as lead generation for direct accounts (carefully)

## The Vision

Transform GTSE from a successful Amazon seller into a **multi-channel, internationally recognized trade supplies brand** that owns its niche through:

1. **Specialist expertise** - We know cable ties better than anyone
2. **Trade-first service** - Built for business, not adapted from consumer
3. **Family business values** - Relationships matter, people answer phones
4. **Global reach** - UK heritage, international capability

## Leadership Driving Growth

- **Freddie Miller (Founder)** - Strategic vision, ex-PwC Hong Kong
- **Tom Armenante (Ecommerce Director)** - Speaking at Retail Ecom North 2026; driving digital excellence
- **Jason Burton (VP Sales North America)** - 13 years cable tie industry; leading US expansion
- **Jon & Karen Miller (Directors)** - SME experience, family foundation
