# Account Based Marketing (ABM) Strategy

**Target Audience**: High-value US B2B Prospects (Construction Firms, Manufacturing Plants, Utility Companies).

## Philosophy
Instead of "spray and pray," we treat individual high-value accounts as markets of one. We do not just want *a* lead; we want *the* Procurement Manager at Bechtel or Turner Construction.

## The Playbook

### 1. Account Selection (The "Hit List")
*   **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**:
    *   Revenue: >$10M
    *   Employees: >50 (specifically in Ops/Safety roles)
    *   Industry: Construction, Industrial, Aerospace, Utilities.
    *   Location: US (focus on regions with high construction activity).
*   **Tools**: Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator and ZoomInfo to build the list.

### 2. The "Surround" Strategy
We target multiple stakeholders within the same company:
*   **The Decision Maker**: Procurement Manager (Cares about price, reliability, terms).
*   **The Influencer**: Site Manager / Safety Officer (Cares about quality, speed, compliance).
*   **The User**: The guy on the site (Cares about usability).

### 3. Campaign Orchestration

#### Week 1: Warm Up
*   **LinkedIn**: Connect with 5 stakeholders. Do not pitch. Engage with their posts.
*   **Ads**: Run targeted LinkedIn Ads to this specific company IP range (if possible) or list. Show them "GTSE Case Studies".

#### Week 2: High-Value Touch
*   **Direct Mail**: Send a "Safety Sample Kit" (Gloves, Ties, Tape) directly to the Site Manager.
    *   *Note*: This costs $20 but is worth $20k in LTV.
*   **Email**: "Hi [Name], I sent a sample kit to your site in [Location]. Wanted to make sure it arrived."

#### Week 3: The Pitch
*   **Call**: "Did you like the quality of the ties? We can set you up with a corporate account: Net-30, 20% off list price, dedicated rep."

## KPIs
*   **Coverage**: % of decision-makers connected on LinkedIn.
*   **Engagement**: % of accounts that accepted the sample kit.
*   **Pipeline Velocity**: Time from "Sample Sent" to "Account Opened".
