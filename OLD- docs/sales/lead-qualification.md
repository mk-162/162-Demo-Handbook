# Lead Qualification Framework (BANT)

When a B2B inquiry comes in (email, phone, or Amazon RFQ), apply **BANT**:

1.  **Budget**: Do they have the budget for a bulk order? Are they looking for "cheap" or "value"?
2.  **Authority**: Is the contact the decision-maker? (Procurement Manager vs. intern).
3.  **Need**: Do we solve their specific problem? (e.g., specific compliance requirement).
4.  **Timeline**: When do they need it?

## The "Welcome Call"
For any new Trade Account registration > $500 potential:
*   **Goal**: Introduce a human point of contact.
*   **Script**: "Hi [Name], I saw you opened a trade account. I wanted to introduce myself as your account manager. I can help with custom quotes if you ever need bulk quantities..."
