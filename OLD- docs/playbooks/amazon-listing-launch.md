## Overview

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch Research (1-2 hours)

### 1.1 Keyword Research

**Tools:** Helium10 Cerebro, Amazon Search Bar, Competitor Listings

```
PRIMARY KEYWORD (1):     [High volume, high relevance]
SECONDARY KEYWORDS (3-5): [Medium volume, specific use cases]
LONG-TAIL KEYWORDS (10+): [Low competition, high intent]
```

**Process:**
1. Enter top 3 competitor ASINs into Helium10 Cerebro
2. Filter: Search Volume > 500, Word Count > 2
3. Export and categorize by intent:
   - **Product terms:** "cable ties", "zip ties", "wire ties"
   - **Use case terms:** "cable ties for outdoor use", "heavy duty zip ties construction"
   - **Specification terms:** "300mm cable ties", "black nylon cable ties"

### 1.2 Competitor Analysis

| Competitor | Price | Reviews | Rating | Title Keywords | Main Image |
|------------|-------|---------|--------|----------------|------------|
| [ASIN 1]   |       |         |        |                |            |
| [ASIN 2]   |       |         |        |                |            |
| [ASIN 3]   |       |         |        |                |            |

**Questions to answer:**
- What are they missing that we can exploit?
- What complaints appear in their negative reviews?
- Where's the gap in their bullet points?

### 1.3 Pricing Strategy

## Troubleshooting

### Not ranking after 30 days?
1. Check indexing: Search ASIN, does it appear?
2. Review keyword relevance: Are you targeting right terms?
3. Conversion issue: Compare CTR and CR to category benchmarks
4. Price check: Are you competitive?

### High ACoS?
1. Pause bleeding keywords (ACoS > 3x target)
2. Add more negatives from search term report
3. Lower bids on broad match, increase exact match
4. Check if product has conversion problem (not PPC problem)

### Negative reviews?
1. Respond within 24 hours
2. Identify if product issue or expectation issue
3. Update listing to set correct expectations
