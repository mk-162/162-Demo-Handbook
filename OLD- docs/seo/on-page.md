# On-Page SEO Strategy

## Keyword Philosophy

We target **high-intent** keywords over high-volume vanity metrics.

| Keyword Type | Example | Intent | GTSE Priority |
|--------------|---------|--------|---------------|
| ❌ Vanity | "gloves" | Informational | Low |
| ⚠️ Generic | "safety gloves" | Mixed | Medium |
| ✅ **B2B Intent** | "industrial safety gloves bulk" | Commercial | **High** |
| ✅ **Problem-Solving** | "cut resistant gloves for mechanics" | Commercial | **High** |

### GTSE Keyword Categories

**Primary (defend/dominate)**:
- "cable ties bulk uk"
- "industrial safety gloves supplier"
- "trade electrical supplies"

**Secondary (grow into)**:
- "wholesale workwear uk"
- "bulk packaging supplies"
- "workshop consumables"

**Long-tail (quick wins)**:
- "what size cable tie do i need"
- "en 388 glove rating explained"
- "next day safety equipment delivery"

## Content Optimization Checklist

For every Product Page (PDP) and Category Page (PLP):

### Title Tag Formula

```
[Primary Keyword] - [Secondary Keyword/USP] | GTSE
```

**Examples**:
- `Nitrile Mechanics Gloves - Oil Resistant, Bulk Pack | GTSE`
- `Heavy Duty Cable Ties 300mm - Trade Pack of 1000 | GTSE`

**Character limit**: 50-60 (Google truncates after ~60)

### Meta Description Formula

```
[Benefit] + [Feature] + [Trust signal] + [CTA]
```

**Examples**:

- "Heavy duty cable ties that won't snap. UV resistant, -40°C rated. Bulk discounts from 1000+. Free shipping over £50."

**Character limit**: 150-160

### Heading Structure

    <h3>Specific Feature 1</h3>
    <h3>Specific Feature 2</h3>
  <h2>Technical Specifications</h2>
  <h2>Customer Reviews</h2>

```

### Image Optimization

| Element | Format | Example |

| Alt text | Descriptive, includes keyword | "Black nitrile mechanics gloves with textured grip" |
| Size | < 100KB for thumbnails, < 300KB for hero | Use TinyPNG or Squoosh |

## GTSE Product Page Template

Every PDP should include:

1. **Above the fold**: Product name, price, star rating, "Add to Cart"

| 3 | Regulation/Compliance | "EN 388 Explained: Understanding Glove Safety Ratings" |
| 4 | Industry Insight | "5 Trends in Industrial Safety for 2024" |

**Target**: 2x high-quality blog posts per month  
**Goal**: Build topical authority for "safety", "industrial", and "trade supplies"

## Internal Linking Strategy

Every page should link to:
- **Parent category** (breadcrumb)
