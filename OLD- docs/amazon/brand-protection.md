# Amazon Brand Protection

Amazon is a battlefield. You must defend your territory.

## The Hijacker Problem
Other sellers might try to list on your ASIN (listing) selling a counterfeit or generic version.
*   **Impact**: They win the Buy Box with a lower price -> Customer gets trash -> Customer leaves 1-star review on YOUR listing.

## Defense Strategy
1.  **Brand Registry**: Mandatory. Gives you tools to report violations.
2.  **Transparency Program**: Apply 2D barcodes to every unit. Amazon scans them before shipping. If a unit doesn't have a code, it's rejected.
3.  **Test Buy**:
    *   If a hijacker appears, buy their product immediately.
    *   Photograph the fake vs your real product.
    *   Open a case with Amazon "Item Not as Described".

## IP Claims
*   **Copyright**: If they use your photos.
*   **Trademark**: If they use your brand name in their text.
*   *Warning*: Do not file false claims. Amazon will ban you.
