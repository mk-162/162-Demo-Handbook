# Amazon DSP (Demand Side Platform) Strategy

Go beyond Sponsored Products. DSP allows us to buy display ads on and off Amazon.

## Retargeting (The Low Hanging Fruit)
*   **Audience**: People who viewed our products but didn't buy in the last 30 days.
*   **Creative**: "Still interested?" / Lifestyle image.
*   **Placement**: Amazon Homepage, Competitor Listings, Third-party sites (CNN, ESPN, etc).

## In-Market Targeting (Conquesting)
*   **Audience**: People browsing "Industrial Safety Gear" or competitor brands.
*   **Strategy**: Show them our "Pro" value prop.

## Loyalty
*   **Audience**: Bought from us 6 months ago.
*   **Message**: "Time to restock?"
