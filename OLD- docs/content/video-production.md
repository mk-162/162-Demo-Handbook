# Video Production Strategy

Video converts 40% better than text on product pages. We need a "YouTube Industrial" approach.

## Video Types

### 1. The "Torture Test" (High Viral Potential)
*   *Concept*: We prove the strength of our products.
*   *Example*: "Can this Cable Tie lift a Honda Civic?"
*   *Usage*: Top of Funnel (Social Media, YouTube Shorts).

### 2. The "360 Product Spin" (Conversion)
*   *Concept*: Simple, silent rotation of the product on white background.
*   *Usage*: Main Product Gallery on BigCommerce and Amazon.

### 3. The "How-To" (Search)
*   *Concept*: Answering specific technical questions.
*   *Example*: "How to release a releasable cable tie" (You'd be surprised how many people search this).
*   *Usage*: Blog posts and Support center.

## Production Standards
*   **Audio**: Clear lapel mic. No echo.
*   **Lighting**: Three-point lighting. Industrial "cool" white tone.
*   **Thumbnails**: High contrast, showing the "action" or the "result". Text overlay in Yellow/Black brand colors.
