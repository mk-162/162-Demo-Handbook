title: Pillar & Cluster Strategy

# Pillar & Cluster Content Strategy

## The Concept
Instead of random blog posts, we build **Topic Clusters**.
*   **Pillar Page**: A massive, definitive guide on a broad topic (e.g., "The Ultimate Guide to Industrial Fasteners").
*   **Cluster Pages**: Specific articles linking back to the Pillar (e.g., "Nylon vs Stainless Steel Ties", "How to calculate tensile strength").

## Planned Clusters

### Cluster 1: Cable Management (The Core)
*   **Pillar**: "Complete Guide to Cable Management for Industry."
*   **Cluster**:
    *   "Heat Stabilized vs UV Resistant: What's the difference?"
    *   "Color Coding Standards for Electricians."
    *   "How to organize a server rack."
    *   "recycling nylon cable ties."

### Cluster 2: Workplace Safety (The Growth)
*   **Pillar**: "PPE & Site Safety Compliance Checklist 2025."
*   **Cluster**:
    *   "ANSI/ISEA 105-2016 Hand Protection Explained."
    *   "High-Vis Classes: Class 1 vs Class 3."
    *   "Restocking your First Aid Kit: OSHA Requirements."

## Internal Linking Rule
*   Every Cluster page **MUST** link to the Pillar in the first paragraph.
*   The Pillar **MUST** link to all Cluster pages.
*   Product Pages **MUST** link to relevant Cluster pages (e.g., "Read our guide on choosing the right size").
