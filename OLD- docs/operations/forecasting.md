# Inventory Forecasting & Purchasing

**Goal**: Never run out of "A-List" items. Never hold too much "C-List" stock.

## ABC Analysis
*   **A-Items**: Top 20% of SKUs generating 80% of revenue.
    *   *Rule*: Always keep 3 months of stock coverage. Reorder point is high.
*   **B-Items**: Moderate sellers.
    *   *Rule*: Keep 2 months coverage.
*   **C-Items**: Slow movers.
    *   *Rule*: Keep 1 month coverage. Review for discontinuation quarterly.

## Seasonality
*   **Q4 (Construction Rush)**: Stock up on outdoor/winter gear in Sept.
*   **Jan (Restock)**: Offices restock supplies. High demand for organizational items.

## Supplier Management
*   **Lead Times**: Track actual vs promised lead times. If a supplier says 4 weeks but takes 6, update the system to 6 to prevent stockouts.
*   **Safety Stock**: Keep an extra buffer for items that come from overseas (China/Vietnam) due to shipping unpredictability.
