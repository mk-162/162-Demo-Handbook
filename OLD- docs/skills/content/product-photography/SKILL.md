# Product Photography Guidelines

## Purpose

This skill provides comprehensive guidelines for creating high-quality product photography for ecommerce listings. It covers platform-specific requirements, equipment recommendations, shooting techniques, post-processing workflows, and file management for consistent, conversion-optimizing imagery.

**Use this skill when:**
- Setting up a product photography workflow
- Training new photographers or team members
- Creating images for new product listings
- Updating existing product imagery

- `target_platforms`: Where images will be used (Amazon, website, eBay, print)
- `image_count`: Number of images needed (typically 7-9)
- `special_requirements`: Any specific shots needed (scale, application, detail)
- `budget_level`: DIY, semi-pro, or professional

## Prerequisites

Before starting this skill:

1. **Equipment Available**
   - Camera or smartphone (see equipment section)
   - Lighting setup (natural or artificial)
   - Shooting surface/backdrop
   - Tripod (recommended)

2. **Products Ready**

### Step 4: Shooting Technique

**What:** Execute the photography with proper technique.

**How:**

#### 4.1 Main Image (White Background)

```markdown
## White Background Shooting Process

### Setup
1. Position backdrop (paper roll or board)
2. Create gentle curve at base (no harsh lines)
3. Set up lights at 45° angles either side
4. Position product on sweep area
5. Mount camera on tripod

### Camera Settings
| Setting | Recommended | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| Mode | Manual or Aperture Priority | Consistent exposures |
| ISO | 100-400 | Minimum noise |
| Aperture | f/8-f/11 | Maximum sharpness, good DOF |
| Shutter | Varies (1/125+ if handheld) | Freeze motion |
| White Balance | Custom or 5500K | Accurate whites |
| Format | RAW + JPEG | Editing flexibility |

### Lighting Setup (Two-Light)
```
        [Main Light 45°]
              ↘
               [Product]
              ↗
        [Fill Light 45°]
              
        [Camera - straight on]
```

**Light Ratios:**
- Main light: Full power
- Fill light: 50-75% of main
- Results in gentle shadows, dimension

### White Background Tips
1. **Overexpose background slightly** (+0.5 to +1 EV)
2. **Keep product well-lit** but not blown out
3. **Check histogram** - spike on right (white) but no clipping
4. **Use reflectors** for shadow fill
5. **Review on computer** - camera LCD can deceive

### Common Problems & Solutions
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Gray background | Increase exposure or background light |
| Product too dark | Add fill light or reflector |
| Hot spots | Diffuse lights more |
| Color cast | Adjust white balance |
| Shadows too harsh | Soften lights, add fill |
| Background not pure white | Adjust in post-processing |
```

#### 4.2 Lifestyle/In-Use Shots

```markdown
## Lifestyle Photography Process

### Location Selection
| Environment | Products | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| Workshop | Tools, fixings | Industrial feel |
| Construction site | Safety, tools | Authentic trade |
| Kitchen/home | DIY products | Consumer appeal |
| Garden/outdoor | Outdoor products | Natural light |
| Office/server room | Cable management | Professional |

### Model Direction
**If using people:**
- Real tradespeople preferred over models
- Authentic workwear/PPE
- Natural poses, caught in action
- Product clearly visible
- Face not required (hands focus okay)

**DIY alternative:**
- Use own hands (clean, neutral)
- Focus on product interaction
- Avoid identifying features

### Lighting for Lifestyle
| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Indoor workshop | Window light + LED fill |
| Outdoor | Natural light, overcast best |
| Office | Existing light + reflector |
| Dark spaces | Portable LED panels |

### Camera Settings (Lifestyle)
| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Aperture | f/4-f/5.6 (subject sharp, background soft) |
| ISO | As needed for exposure |
| Focus | On product/interaction |
| Style | Slightly underexposed, warm |

### Composition Tips
- Rule of thirds: Product at intersection point
- Leading lines: Draw eye to product
- Depth: Foreground/background separation
- Context: Environment supports product story
- Action: Capture moment of use
```

#### 4.3 Detail & Macro Shots

```markdown
## Close-Up Photography Process

### Equipment for Macro
| Option | When to Use | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Macro lens | Small details (<10cm) | Best quality |
| Extension tubes | Budget macro | Some quality loss |
| Close-up filters | Very budget | Variable quality |
| Smartphone macro | Quick shots | Attachment lens helps |

### Focus Stacking (For maximum sharpness)
**When needed:**
- Very close distances
- Deep product (front-to-back)
- Need full sharpness

**Process:**
1. Camera on tripod (critical)
2. Take 5-15 shots, adjusting focus through product
3. Combine in Photoshop or Helicon Focus
4. Result: Full depth sharpness

### Lighting for Macro
- Soft, diffused light essential
- Use tent or white sheet for tiny products
- Avoid harsh shadows
- Consider ring light for even illumination

### Detail Shot Ideas by Product
| Product | Detail Focus |
|---------|--------------|
| Cable ties | Locking mechanism, surface texture |
| Screws | Thread pattern, head drive |
| Tools | Handle grip, mechanism, blade edge |
| PPE | Material close-up, seams, padding |
| Connectors | Terminal detail, weatherproofing |

```

#### 5.2 Color Correction

```markdown
## Color Correction Process

### Step 1: White Balance
**In Lightroom/Camera Raw:**
1. Use Eyedropper tool on gray card (if shot)
2. Or select "Auto" as starting point
3. Fine-tune Temp and Tint sliders
4. Target: Neutral whites, accurate colors

**Keyboard reference:**
- Too warm (yellow): Reduce Temperature
- Too cool (blue): Increase Temperature
- Too green: Increase Tint (magenta)
- Too magenta: Decrease Tint

### Step 2: Exposure Adjustment
**Goals:**
- Product well-exposed, not too bright or dark
- Whites are white (not gray or blown)
- Details visible in shadows and highlights

**Adjustments:**
- Exposure: Overall brightness
- Highlights: Recover bright areas
- Shadows: Lift dark areas
- Whites: Set white point
- Blacks: Set black point

### Step 3: Color Accuracy
**Ensure product colors match reality:**
1. Use calibrated monitor
2. Reference actual product
3. Adjust HSL/Color sliders if needed
4. Check multiple variants match packaging

### Step 4: Consistency
**All images should match:**
- Same white background brightness
- Same color temperature
- Same overall exposure feel
- Apply same preset across series

### Quick Preset Creation
**In Lightroom:**
1. Edit one image perfectly
2. Create preset from settings
3. Apply to similar images
4. Tweak individuals as needed
```

#### 5.3 Retouching

```markdown

## Appendix

### A: Camera Settings Quick Reference

| Situation | ISO | Aperture | Shutter | Notes |
|-----------|-----|----------|---------|-------|
| Studio (strobes) | 100 | f/11 | 1/125 | Sync speed dependent |
| Studio (continuous) | 200-400 | f/8-f/11 | 1/60-1/125 | Tripod required |
| Natural light | 200-800 | f/8 | 1/60+ | Use reflectors |
| Lifestyle (indoors) | 400-1600 | f/4-f/5.6 | 1/125+ | May need flash |
| Lifestyle (outdoors) | 100-400 | f/5.6-f/8 | 1/250+ | Watch highlights |
| Macro/detail | 100-200 | f/8-f/16 | Varies | Tripod, focus stack |

### B: White Background RGB Verification

**In Photoshop:**
1. Use Eyedropper tool
2. Sample background area
3. Check Info panel: R=255, G=255, B=255
4. Anything less than 250/250/250 may appear gray

**Quick fix if gray:**
1. Select > Color Range > Highlights
2. Levels adjustment: Push whites
3. Or use Curves: Lift high end

### C: Mobile Thumbnail Test

Before uploading, view at actual thumbnail sizes:
- Amazon search: 160×160 px
- Amazon PDP: 40×40 px (mini)
- Website grid: 200×200 px
- eBay search: 225×225 px

If product unrecognizable or text unreadable at these sizes, adjust composition.

### D: Color Checker Reference

If using X-Rite/Calibrite ColorChecker:
1. Include in first shot of each lighting setup
2. In Lightroom: Select gray patch, use as white balance
3. Can create camera/lens profile for accuracy
4. Remove from final images
