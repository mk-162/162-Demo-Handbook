## SEQUENCE PHILOSOPHY

### Core Principles

1. **Value-first, always** - Every touch should offer something useful
2. **Respect attention** - Don't waste their time with fluff
3. **Multiple channels** - Email + LinkedIn + Phone works better than one
4. **Know when to stop** - Persistent ≠ annoying
5. **Easy opt-out** - Make it simple to say no

### B2B Industrial Reality

- Trade buyers are busy
- They get a lot of sales emails
- Trust is earned, not assumed
- Decisions often involve multiple people
- Timing matters (project-based buying)

## STANDARD SEQUENCES

### Sequence A: New Lead (Cold Prospect)

**Duration:** 3 weeks, 6 touchpoints
**Goal:** Get initial conversation or quote request

```
Day 1: Email 1 (Value-first introduction)
Day 3: LinkedIn connection request
Day 5: Email 2 (Case study/social proof)
Day 8: LinkedIn message (if connected)
Day 12: Email 3 (Direct value offer)
Day 18: Email 4 (Breakup email)
```

#### Day 1: Email 1 - Value Introduction

**Subject:** Quick question about your supplies ordering

```
Hi [First Name],

I work with [industry] companies on their trade supplies - things like cable ties, PPE, and site equipment.

Quick question: would it be useful to have a single UK supplier with trade pricing and next-day delivery?

If you're already sorted, no worries. But if comparing could save [Company Name] money, I'm happy to put together a quote.

What do you typically order most?

[Name]
GTSE Trade Supplies
```

#### Day 3: LinkedIn Connection Request

```
Hi [First Name], I work with [industry] companies on trade supplies. Would be great to connect - not here to spam, just good to know people in the trade! [Name]
```

#### Day 5: Email 2 - Social Proof

**Subject:** How [Similar Company Type] streamlined their ordering

```
Hi [First Name],

Following up quickly - wanted to share how we've helped companies like [Company Name].

[Similar company type] switched to GTSE because:
• One supplier for cable ties, fixings, PPE, site equipment
• Trade pricing that saves 15-20% vs retail
• Actual stock levels (no backorder surprises)

Would it be worth a 5-minute call to see if we could help [Company Name]?

No pressure - just trying to be useful.

[Name]
```

#### Day 8: LinkedIn Message (If Connected)

```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

Saw my email? No worries if it got buried - just wanted to see if comparing trade suppliers would be useful for [Company].

Happy to send a quick quote if you tell me what you typically order.

[Name]
```

#### Day 12: Email 3 - Direct Value

**Subject:** Trade quote for [Company Name]?

```
Hi [First Name],

One more quick note - I'd love to put together a trade quote for [Company Name].

If you can share:
• What products you order regularly
• Typical order sizes
• Any specific brands/specs

I'll show you exactly what you'd pay with a GTSE trade account.

Takes 2 minutes, and there's no obligation.

Worth a look?

[Name]
```

#### Day 18: Email 4 - Breakup Email

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

```
Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back - totally understand you're busy.

I'll assume the timing isn't right for [Company Name] to look at a new supplier.

If that changes, I'm here. We stock a wide range of cable ties, PPE, and trade supplies with next-day delivery.

Thanks for your time.

[Name]

P.S. - Happy to stop emailing. Just let me know either way!

## SEQUENCE AUTOMATION NOTES

### If Using CRM/Email Automation

**Recommended setup:**
1. Enroll lead in appropriate sequence
2. Set delay triggers between steps
3. Auto-pause if:
   - They reply (any reply)
   - They book meeting/call
   - They convert to customer
   - They unsubscribe
4. Track opens/clicks for timing optimization

### Manual Sequences

**Weekly workflow:**
1. Monday: Check for replies, update statuses
2. Tue-Thu: Send new outreach, make calls
3. Friday: Review, move to next sequence step

---

## MEASURING SEQUENCE PERFORMANCE

### Metrics by Sequence

| Metric | New Lead | Warm Lead | Quote F/U |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Reply rate | >5% | >15% | >25% |
| Meeting rate | >2% | >5% | N/A |
| Conversion | >1% | >3% | >20% |

### Optimization Signals

**If reply rate is low:**
- Test different subject lines
- Shorten emails
- Adjust timing
- Improve personalization

**If opens are high but replies low:**
- CTA unclear
- Value prop not resonating
- Too much friction to respond

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

When creating a sequence:

1. **Ask for context:**
   - Lead source (cold/warm/quote)
   - Industry/segment
   - Account size/value
   - Any prior interactions

2. **Provide:**
   - Complete sequence with all touchpoints
   - Exact timing between touches
   - Email copy for each step
   - LinkedIn messages if applicable
   - Phone script bullet points
