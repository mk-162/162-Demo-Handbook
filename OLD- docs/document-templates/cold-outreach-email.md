## Example

### Initial Outreach Email

```markdown
Subject: Question about your commercial electrical work

---

Hi Mark,

I noticed Smith Electrical completed the new Tesco Express fit-out in Bromley – nice work on a tight deadline.

Projects like that need reliable cable management supplies delivered on time. That's what we do at GTSE. We supply trade electricians with cable ties, trunking, and fixings – same-day dispatch, next-day delivery, no minimum order.

Last month we helped Davies Electrical cut their supply costs by 18% by consolidating their cable management orders with us.

Would it be worth a quick call to see if we could help with your upcoming projects?

Best regards,
Sarah Mitchell

### Follow-up 1 (Day 3-4)

```markdown
Subject: Re: Question about your commercial electrical work

---

Hi Mark,

Just floating this back up – I know how hectic project schedules can get.

One thing I didn't mention: we offer 30-day payment terms for established trade accounts. Helps with cash flow on bigger jobs.

Happy to send over our trade price list if it's useful – no commitment.

Best regards,
Sarah
```

### Follow-up 2 (Day 7-8)

```markdown
Subject: GTSE trade pricing for Smith Electrical

---

Hi Mark,

Different approach – I've put together a quick comparison showing our pricing vs typical distributor rates for the cable management items electricians order most.

Might save you 15-20% on your regular orders.

Want me to send it over?

Best regards,
Sarah
```

### Follow-up 3 - Breakup (Day 14)

```markdown
Subject: Should I close your file?

---

Hi Mark,

I've reached out a few times about helping with cable management supplies. No response usually means the timing isn't right, and I don't want to keep bothering you.

I'll assume it's not a priority right now and won't follow up again.

If things change in future, you can reach me at sarah@gtse.co.uk or 01onal 234 5678. We're always happy to help trade electricians get better pricing and reliability.

All the best,
Sarah

## Notes

### Opening Hook Strategies

| Strategy | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Observation** | "I noticed you completed the new Tesco fit-out..." |
| **Mutual connection** | "John Davies mentioned you might be looking for..." |
| **Industry insight** | "With the new wiring regs coming in April..." |
| **Their content** | "Saw your post about the solar installation..." |
| **Recent news** | "Congrats on the NICEIC accreditation..." |

**Avoid:**
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "My name is... and I work at..."
- Generic intros that could apply to anyone

### Value Proposition Framework

**Problem → Solution → Benefit**

"[Problem they likely have] is frustrating. [What we do] so that [specific outcome they want]."

Example: "Unreliable deliveries throw off your project schedule. We dispatch same-day and deliver next-day across the UK, so you're never waiting on supplies."

### Social Proof Types

- Named customer + specific result
- Industry-specific reference
- Number of customers served
- Years in business
- Certifications/accreditations

**Weak:** "Hundreds of happy customers"
**Strong:** "Last month we helped Davies Electrical cut supply costs by 18%"

### CTA Best Practices

| Type | Example | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Question** | "Would a quick call be useful?" | Initial outreach |
| **Low commitment** | "Want me to send the price list?" | Follow-up 1 |
| **Specific offer** | "Can I send the comparison doc?" | Follow-up 2 |
| **Easy out** | "Should I close your file?" | Breakup email |

**Always:**
- One CTA per email
- Make it easy to say yes
- Don't require calendar gymnastics

### Timing

- **Initial send**: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am
- **Follow-up 1**: 3-4 days later
- **Follow-up 2**: 3-4 days after that
- **Breakup**: 5-7 days after follow-up 2

### Personalisation Checklist

Before sending, verify:
- [ ] First name is correct
- [ ] Company name is spelled right
- [ ] Reference is accurate and current
- [ ] Industry assumptions are valid
- [ ] No copy-paste errors from previous emails

### Legal Requirements (UK)

- Include physical business address
- Provide unsubscribe option for marketing
- Identify the email as commercial if required
- Comply with GDPR for data handling
