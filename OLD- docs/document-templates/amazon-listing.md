## Product Description

Looking for cable ties that actually hold?

GTSE Heavy Duty Cable Ties deliver industrial-grade performance for professionals and serious DIYers. Unlike flimsy alternatives that snap under tension or degrade in sunlight, our ties are manufactured from premium UV-stabilised Nylon 66 with a 54kg tensile strength rating.

Each tie features a smooth, rounded design that protects delicate cables during installation, plus a precision self-locking head that grips securely without over-tightening. The operating temperature range of -40°C to +85°C means reliable performance in freezing outdoor conditions through to warm server rooms.

Use them for data centre cable management, outdoor CCTV installations, automotive wiring harnesses, construction site temporary fixes, or home workshop organisation. The 300mm length handles bundles up to 76mm diameter.

GTSE has supplied cable management products to UK trade customers since 2010. We stand behind every product with responsive customer support.

Package Contains: 100 x Black Cable Ties (300mm x 7.6mm)
