### Email 4: Case Study / Social Proof (Day 10)

```markdown
Subject: How Smith Electrical Cut Their Supply Costs by 23%

---

Hi James,

Wanted to share how one of our trade customers streamlined their ordering:

**Smith Electrical Services – Commercial Electrical Contractor**

Mark's team was ordering cable management supplies from three different suppliers, dealing with inconsistent quality and unpredictable delivery times.

After consolidating with GTSE, they reduced their supplier admin time by 6 hours per month and negotiated better bulk pricing on their most-used items.

The result: 23% reduction in cable management costs and next-day delivery they can actually rely on.

"We should have done this years ago. One supplier, one account, consistent quality."
— Mark Smith, Owner

## Notes

### Timing
- **Day 0**: Send immediately upon account creation
- **Day 2**: Early enough to be helpful, not overwhelming
- **Day 5**: Product value before asking for purchase
- **Day 10**: Social proof builds trust before offer
- **Day 14**: Offer creates urgency, but not too soon

### Subject Line Tips
- Keep under 50 characters for mobile
- Personalise with name if possible
- Be specific about value/content
- Avoid spam triggers (FREE, ACT NOW, etc.)

### Tone
- Professional but warm
- First-name basis appropriate for B2B
- Focus on helping, not selling
- Consistent sender name builds familiarity

### Personalisation Tokens
- `{{FIRST_NAME}}` - Customer's first name
- `{{COMPANY_NAME}}` - Their business name
- `{{ACCOUNT_TYPE}}` - Trade tier if applicable
- `{{LAST_ORDER_DATE}}` - For re-engagement

### Metrics to Track
- Open rates (aim for 25%+ for B2B)
- Click-through rates (aim for 3-5%)
- Unsubscribe rate (should be <0.5%)
- Conversion to first order

### A/B Testing Ideas
- Subject line variations
- CTA button vs text link
- Offer percentage vs fixed amount
- Case study industry relevance
