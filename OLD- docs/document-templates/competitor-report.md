---

## Product Comparison

### Overlapping Product Categories

| Category | CableTiesOnline | GTSE | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|------|-------|
| Nylon Cable Ties | Full range, 50+ SKUs | Full range, 40+ SKUs | CTO has more niche sizes |

---

## Price Comparison

### Key Products (Like-for-Like)

| Product | CableTiesOnline | GTSE | Difference | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|------|------------|-------|
| Cable Ties 300x7.6mm Black (100pk) | £8.49 | £7.99 | GTSE -6% | Key volume product |
| Cable Ties 200x4.8mm Black (100pk) | £4.79 | £4.49 | GTSE -6% | Key volume product |
| Cable Ties 370x7.6mm Black (100pk) | £10.49 | £9.99 | GTSE -5% | Competitive |
| Cable Ties 100x2.5mm Natural (100pk) | £2.99 | £3.29 | CTO -9% | CTO undercuts on small ties |
| Heavy Duty 9mm Width (50pk) | £12.99 | £11.99 | GTSE -8% | Good GTSE margin product |

### Pricing Strategy Assessment
CableTiesOnline prices slightly higher on core products but runs frequent promotions (typically 10-15% off). Their regular prices create anchor that makes promotions feel significant. GTSE everyday pricing is more competitive, but less promotional activity may reduce urgency.

---

## Strengths & Weaknesses

### CableTiesOnline Strengths
- **Product Specialism**: Deep expertise in cable ties specifically – seen as the go-to
- **Amazon Optimisation**: Well-crafted listings, A+ content, strong organic ranking
- **Niche Products**: Metal detectable and releasable ties for specialist applications
- **Brand Recognition**: Longer established, more reviews, higher brand search volume

### CableTiesOnline Weaknesses
- **Narrow Focus**: Limited to cable ties – can't serve customers needing broader range
- **Website UX**: Dated design, slow loading, poor mobile experience
- **Customer Service**: Reviews mention slow response times to queries
- **No Trade Account**: Website lacks B2B features like payment terms

---

## Channel Comparison

### Website

| Factor | CableTiesOnline | GTSE | Winner |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|
| Design/UX | 5/10 | 7/10 | GTSE |
| Product Range | 200 SKUs | 450 SKUs | GTSE |
| Site Speed | 4.2s load | 2.1s load | GTSE |
| Mobile Experience | 4/10 | 7/10 | GTSE |
| Search/Filter | Basic | Good | GTSE |
| Trust Signals | Trustpilot, industry logos | Trustpilot, ISO, Trade accounts | GTSE |
| Delivery Options | Next-day, £3.99 | Next-day free over £50 | GTSE |

**Website Notes:** GTSE has significant advantages in website experience. CTO's site feels like it hasn't been updated in 5+ years. This is an opportunity to win customers frustrated with poor UX.

### Amazon

| Factor | CableTiesOnline | GTSE | Winner |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|
| Number of Listings | 85 | 62 | CTO |
| Average Rating | 4.6/5 | 4.5/5 | CTO |
| Review Count | 12,400+ | 2,800+ | CTO |
| Prime/FBA | Yes (all) | Yes (most) | Tie |
| A+ Content | Yes (all listings) | Partial | CTO |
| Brand Store | Well-designed | Basic | CTO |

**Amazon Notes:** CTO significantly ahead on Amazon with more reviews and better content. Priority should be improving A+ content and actively requesting reviews to close gap.

|  | Helpful | Harmful |
|--|---------|---------|
| **Internal** | **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|  | Better website experience | Fewer Amazon reviews |

| **External** | **Opportunities** | **Threats** |

|  | Specialist niche products (metal detect) | Amazon algorithm changes |
