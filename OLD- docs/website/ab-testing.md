# A/B Testing Guide

We don't guess; we test.

## The Process
1.  **Hypothesis**: "I think making the 'Add to Cart' button bigger will increase clicks."
2.  **Test**: Run 50% traffic to Control, 50% to Variant.
3.  **Significance**: Wait for 95% statistical significance (use a calculator).
4.  **Implement**: Roll out the winner.

## High-Impact Test Ideas
1.  **Sticky Add-to-Cart**: On mobile, keep the buy button stuck to the bottom of the screen as they scroll.
2.  **Free Shipping Threshold**: Test $50 vs $75 vs $100. Does AOV go up enough to cover the shipping cost?
3.  **Trust Badges**: Test "Made in UK/USA" vs "Satisfaction Guaranteed".
4.  **Review Position**: Test reviews near the title vs reviews near the bottom.

## Tools
*   **VWO** or **Google Optimize** (if available/replaced).
*   **Microsoft Clarity**: For heatmaps and session recording.
