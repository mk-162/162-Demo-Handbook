# Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) Checklist

Traffic is vanity; conversion is sanity.

## The PDP (Product Detail Page) Anatomy

### Above the Fold
*   [ ] **Title**: Clear, descriptive, includes MPN (Manufacturer Part Number).
*   [ ] **Price**: Large font. Show "MSRP" struck through if on sale.
*   [ ] **Stock Status**: "In Stock - Ships Today" (Green text).
*   [ ] **Add to Cart**: Massive, contrasting button (Yellow/Gold).
*   [ ] **Bulk Table**: Show the tiered pricing clearly. "Buy 100+: Save 20%".

### Trust Signals (Near Buy Button)
*   [ ] **Payment Icons**: Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Amex.
*   [ ] **Security Badge**: "Secure SSL Checkout".
*   [ ] **Guarantees**: "365 Day Returns", "Lifetime Warranty".

### Content Area
*   [ ] **Tabs**: Description, Specifications, Delivery, Reviews.
*   [ ] **Specs**: Use a table. Length, Width, Material, Tensile Strength, Temp Rating.
*   [ ] **Cross-Sells**: "Frequently Bought Together" (e.g., Cable Ties + Cutters).

## Checkout Optimization
*   **Guest Checkout**: MANDATORY. Do not force account creation.
*   **Address Validator**: Use Google Places API to auto-complete addresses (reduces typing fatigue).

## Speed Optimization
*   **Images**: Compress to WebP.
*   **Scripts**: Defer non-essential JS (Chatbots, tracking pixels).
*   **Core Web Vitals**: Aim for LCP < 2.5s.
