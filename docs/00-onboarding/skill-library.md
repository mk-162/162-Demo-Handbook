# The 162 Skill Library

Your Handbook is not static. It is connected to the **162 Master Library**, a centralised repository of vetted, optimised AI workflows.

## How it Works

We maintain a public library of workflows for SEO, Content, Finance, and HR. You can import any of these into your private Handbook instantly.

## How to Import a Skill

You don't need to download files or copy code. Just ask your Agent.

**Command:**
> "Agent, please check the 162 Library for an 'SEO Audit' skill and install it."

**What happens next:**
1. The Agent connects to our public repository
2. It reads the `RUNBOOK.md` for that skill
3. It creates a new folder in your `02-workflows/` directory
4. It adapts the skill to match your `brand.md` (optional customisation)
5. The skill is ready to use immediately

## How to Update a Skill

When we improve a workflow, you can pull the latest version:

**Command:**
> "Agent, update the SEO Audit skill."

**What happens:**
1. The Agent fetches the latest version
2. It creates a Pull Request for you to review
3. You click "Merge" on GitHub when ready
4. The updated skill is now active

## Why Pull Requests for Updates?

We use PRs to protect your business:
- You can review changes before they go live
- If an update requires a new connection you don't have, you'll see it first
- Your customisations won't be overwritten without your approval
