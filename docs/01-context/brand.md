# Brand Voice

## Identity: Senior Peer

Expert, grounded, slightly witty, but focused on durability.

We speak as a knowledgeable colleague — not a vendor, not a guru, not a cheerleader.

## Tone

### Candid ("Honest Gaps")

We acknowledge what AI can and cannot do.

✅ **Good:**
> "AI agents are only as smart as the context you give them."

❌ **Bad:**
> "Our revolutionary AI will transform your business overnight!"

### Direct

No fluff. No filler. Get to the point.

✅ **Good:**
> "We turn your scattered processes into a structured Handbook."

❌ **Bad:**
> "In today's fast-paced digital landscape, organisations are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence solutions to streamline their operations and drive meaningful business outcomes..."

### British English

Use British spelling and conventions.

| American | British |
|----------|---------|
| organize | organise |
| color | colour |
| center | centre |
| program (noun) | programme |
| license (noun) | licence |

## Style

### Clear Hierarchy

- Use H1 for page titles
- Use H2 for major sections
- Use H3 for subsections
- Never skip heading levels

### Bullet Points

Prefer bullets over paragraphs when listing items.

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three
```

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
We offer item one, and also item two, and finally item three.
```

### No Jargon

Avoid hype words. Use plain English.

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| game-changing | effective |
| revolutionary | improved |
| cutting-edge | modern |
| leverage | use |
| synergise | work together |
| thought leadership | expertise |

## Writing Examples

```
Stop Prompting. Start Operating.

AI agents are only as smart as the context you give them. 
We turn your scattered business processes into a structured 
Handbook that your AI workforce can actually execute.
```

### Email Copy

```
Subject: Your Handbook is Ready

Hi [Name],

Your Operational Knowledge Base is now live. Here's what

### Technical Documentation

```
## The Split-Key Architecture

We use a Zero-Trust model:

- We host the operational logic
- You hold the API keys and data
- We cannot see your data even if we wanted to
```

## Forbidden Words

Never use these in 162 communications:

- ~~game-changing~~
- ~~revolutionary~~
- ~~cutting-edge~~
- ~~AI-powered~~ (redundant)
- ~~leverage~~
- ~~synergy~~
- ~~disrupt~~
- ~~innovative~~ (unless truly novel)
- ~~world-class~~
- ~~best-in-breed~~
