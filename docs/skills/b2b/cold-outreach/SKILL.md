Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Company Name] works in [industry/sector] - we supply a lot of companies like yours with [specific products relevant to their industry].

Quick question: how are you currently handling your [cable management/PPE/supplies] orders?

A few companies in your space have switched to us recently because:
• [Benefit 1 - e.g., "We carry everything in stock, no waiting"]
• [Benefit 2 - e.g., "Trade pricing that actually saves money on volume"]
• [Benefit 3 - e.g., "Next-day delivery, no minimum order"]

Would a trade account make sense for [Company Name]? Takes 2 minutes to set up.

Happy to send over a quote if you let me know what you typically order.

Best,

Hi [First Name],

Here's something I hear from [industry] companies:

"We ran out of [product] on a Friday afternoon and had to scramble."

Sound familiar?

At GTSE, we've made it really simple:
→ Order by [time], get it next working day
→ Real stock levels (no "oh sorry, that's backordered")
→ Trade account = faster reorders

What does your current supplier do when you need something urgently?

If reliable supply would help [Company Name], let's have a quick chat.

[Name]
```

**Subject lines:**
- "How [Similar Company Type] saved 20% on supplies"
- "[X] [Industry] companies are already doing this"
- "Your competitors might be getting better pricing"

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

We've been working with quite a few [industry type] companies recently - [example if public, or "similar size to yours"].

The main reasons they switched to GTSE:
1. Trade pricing that's genuinely competitive (happy to prove it)
2. UK stock, next-day delivery
3. One supplier for cable ties, PPE, site equipment

I'm not sure if you're happy with your current setup, but if you're open to comparing, I'd be glad to put together a quote.

Would that be useful?
