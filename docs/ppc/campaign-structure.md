# PPC Campaign Structure

## Segmentation
To prevent budget wastage, campaigns must be segmented strictly.

1.  **By Geography**:
    *   `UK_Search_Generic`
    *   `US_Search_Generic`
    *   *Reason*: Different currencies, shipping costs, and intent.

2.  **By Match Type** (Optional but recommended for scale):
    *   Separate Exact Match (High bid) from Broad Match (Low bid/Discovery).

3.  **By Product Category**:
    *   Don't lump "Cable Ties" with "Safety Boots". Each needs specific Negative Keywords.

## Ad Copy Best Practices
*   **Headline 1**: Product/Service Name (matches keyword).
*   **Headline 2**: Value Prop / Differentiator (e.g., "Next Day Delivery", "Bulk Trade Pricing").
*   **Headline 3**: Brand Name.
*   **Description**: Benefits + CTA. "Rated 4.9 Stars. Get a Quote Today."

## B2B Specific Tactics
*   Use "Lead Form" extensions for bulk inquiries.
*   Target keywords like "wholesale", "bulk", "supplier", "distributor".
*   Dayparting: Bid higher during business hours (M-F, 9-5).
