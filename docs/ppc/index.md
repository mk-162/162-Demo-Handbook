# Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Strategy

PPC provides immediate visibility while SEO builds long-term authority. We focus on ROI, B2B acquisition, and supporting organic growth.

## Why PPC for GTSE

| Goal | PPC Role |
|------|----------|
| **New product launch** | Instant visibility before SEO kicks in |
| **Seasonal demand** | Capture spikes (Q4 trade orders) |
| **Competitor defence** | Bid on own brand + competitor terms |
| **Testing** | Validate keywords before SEO investment |

## Channels

| Channel | Best For | GTSE Priority |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Google Search** | High-intent capture | ★★★ Primary |
| **Google Shopping** | Product visibility, price comparison | ★★★ Primary |
| **Bing/Microsoft** | B2B demographics, lower CPC | ★★ Secondary |
| **YouTube** | Brand awareness, how-to content | ★ Testing |
| **Display/GDN** | Remarketing only | ★ Limited |

## Budget Recommendations

### Monthly Budget Allocation

| Channel | % of Total | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Google Search | 50% | Core conversions |
| Google Shopping | 30% | Product feed essential |
| Bing | 15% | Often 20-30% lower CPC |
| Remarketing | 5% | Cart abandoners, browsers |

### Budget by Business Stage

| Stage | Monthly Budget | Focus |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| **Testing** | £500-1,000 | Keyword discovery, CPA benchmarks |
| **Growth** | £2,000-5,000 | Scale winners, add Shopping |
| **Scale** | £5,000-15,000 | Full funnel, competitor conquest |
| **Mature** | £10,000+ | Brand defence, market share |

### GTSE-Specific Recommendations

**Current priority** (based on margin and competition):
1. **Cable Ties** - High margin, own the space
2. **Safety Gloves** - Competitive but high volume
3. **Trade Account signups** - Long-term value

**Avoid overspending on**:
- Generic terms without "bulk", "trade", or "industrial"
- Consumer-focused queries (low AOV)

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **ROAS** | > 4:1 | £4 revenue per £1 spent |
| **CPA (Trade Account)** | < £25 | High LTV justifies higher CPA |
| **CPC (Branded)** | < £0.20 | Defend brand cheaply |
| **Impression Share** | > 80% (brand), > 30% (generic) | Visibility benchmark |
