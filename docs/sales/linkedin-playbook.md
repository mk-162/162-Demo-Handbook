# LinkedIn Outreach Playbook

## Profile Optimization (Personal Brand)
Before outreach, you must look credible.
*   **Headline**: Not "Sales Rep". Use "Industrial Supply Specialist | Helping Construction Firms Reduce Procurement Costs".
*   **Banner**: GTSE branded, showing a warehouse or products (Scale).
*   **Featured**: Link to the "Trade Account Application" or a Case Study.

## The Connection Routine
*   **Trigger**: New job role ("New Procurement Manager at X"), Company Funding News, Project Announcement.
*   **Note**:
    > "Hi [Name], saw you just started at [Company]. We work with a few other firms in [City] on their site supplies. connecting to share some market updates."

## Content Strategy for Reps
Sales reps should post 1-2x per week.
*   **The "Behind the Scenes"**: Photo of a pallet going out. "Another 50k cable ties heading to a wind farm in Texas." (Demonstrates scale).
*   **The "Problem Solver"**: "Client called at 4pm needing tape. We got it there by 8am." (Demonstrates service).

## Sales Navigator Lists
Create saved searches for:
1.  **"Construction Project Managers"** in **"Texas/California/Florida"**.
2.  **"Procurement Officers"** in **"Manufacturing"** with headcount > 200.
