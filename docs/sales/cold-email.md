# Cold Email Playbook

**Goal**: Book a discovery call or get a sample request.

## The Golden Rules
1.  **Subject Lines**: Boring is better.
    *   *Bad*: "🔥 huge savings for [Company]!!!"
    *   *Good*: "Supply question for [Company]" or "Cable ties for [Project]"
2.  **Length**: Under 120 words.
3.  **The "Ask"**: Low friction. Don't ask for a meeting; ask for interest.

## Scripts

### Script A: The "Competitor" Angle
*Subject: Alternative to Uline*

> Hi [Name],
>
> I noticed [Company] is scaling up operations in [Region].
>
> Most Ops Managers I talk to are frustrated with paying Uline's premium for standard consumables like zip ties and tape.
>
> At GTSE, we supply the exact same industrial-grade specs, but typically 30% cheaper because we don't send you a 500-page catalog.
>
> Open to seeing a price comparison?
>
> Best,
> [Agent Name]

### Script B: The "Project" Angle (Construction)
*Subject: Supplies for [Project Name]*

> Hi [Name],
>
> Saw you guys broke ground on the [Project Name]. Congratulations.
>
> We help sites like this streamline their consumables—bulk cable ties, safety gear, fixing bands. We offer Net-60 terms for major construction projects to help with cash flow.
>
> Would you be opposed to me sending a sample pack to the site office?
>
> Best,
> [Agent Name]

## Follow-Up Sequence
1.  **Day 1**: Initial Email.
2.  **Day 3**: "Bump" - "Any thoughts on this?"
3.  **Day 7**: Value Add - "Here's a guide we wrote on compliance standards for fastening..."
4.  **Day 14**: Break up - "Assuming this isn't a priority right now. I'll take you off my list."
