# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO is our long-term play to reduce reliance on Amazon and Paid Media. Our strategy is built on three pillars: Technical, On-Page, and Off-Page.

## Why SEO Matters for GTSE

| Channel | CAC | Sustainability | Control |
|---------|-----|----------------|---------|
| Amazon | High (15-30% fees) | Low (algorithm dependent) | Low |
| PPC | Medium | None (stops when spend stops) | Medium |
| **SEO** | Low (content investment) | **High** | **High** |

**The B2B SEO Advantage**: Trade customers search Google before Amazon. They want suppliers, bulk pricing, and account terms—queries where GTSE can dominate.

## GTSE SEO Priorities

### Tier 1: High-Intent Product Categories
- `/cable-ties/` - Our strongest category, defend position 1-3
- `/safety-gloves/` - Competitive, needs content investment
- `/electrical/` - Growing category, build authority

### Tier 2: B2B Landing Pages
- `/trade-account/` - Captures "wholesale supplier" queries
- `/bulk-discounts/` - Targets "bulk buy" searches
- `/next-day-delivery/` - UK-specific intent

### Tier 3: Informational Content
- How-to guides (e.g., "how to choose the right cable tie size")
- Compliance/regulation pages (e.g., "EN 388 glove ratings explained")
- Industry roundups (topical authority signals)
