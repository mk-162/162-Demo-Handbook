# Customer Service Script Library

## Scenario: Where is my order? (Late)
> "Hi [Name], I'm so sorry your order hasn't arrived yet. I've checked the tracking and it looks like it's stuck at the [Location] hub. I have personally contacted the courier to get an update. In the meantime, I have refunded your shipping costs as an apology. I will email you again in 24 hours with a solution."

## Scenario: Damaged Item
> "I am terrible sorry to hear the [Product] arrived damaged. That is not our standard. Please don't worry about sending the broken one back. I have just expedited a replacement to you which should arrive tomorrow. Is there anything else I can do to make this right?"

## Scenario: Angry Customer (De-escalation)
> "I completely understand why you are frustrated, [Name]. I would be too. I want to fix this for you immediately. Here is what I can do..." (Offer solution, not excuses).

## Scenario: Asking for a Review (After positive interaction)
> "I'm glad we could get that sorted, [Name]. If you have a spare second, would you mind clicking this link to rate my help today? It really helps the team."
