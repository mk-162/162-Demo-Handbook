```markdown
• INDUSTRIAL STRENGTH 114KG TENSILE: Professional-grade Nylon 6/6 construction 
  with 114kg (251lb) tensile strength. Built for demanding applications in 
  construction, automotive, and industrial settings where standard ties fail.

  direct sunlight, rain, and temperature extremes from -40°C to 85°C. Install 
  outdoors with confidence—these ties won't degrade or snap.

• PRECISION DIMENSIONS: 300mm length x 4.8mm width provides the ideal 
  balance of flexibility and strength. Bundle diameter up to 80mm. Exact 
  specifications for trade professionals who need consistent sizing.

```

#### Stainless Steel Cable Ties - 5 Bullet Structure

```markdown
• MAXIMUM STRENGTH 160KG TENSILE: Marine-grade 316 stainless steel with 
  160kg (352lb) tensile strength. Designed for extreme environments where 
  nylon ties can't survive—offshore, chemical plants, high-temperature zones.

• CORROSION RESISTANT: 316 stainless steel grade provides superior resistance 
  to saltwater, chemicals, and oxidation. Ideal for marine, coastal, and 
  industrial installations exposed to harsh elements.

• SELF-LOCKING BALL MECHANISM: Secure ball-lock design provides permanent 
  hold. Once tensioned, the tie cannot be loosened—ensuring cables and 
  components stay bundled for life.

• WIDE TEMPERATURE RANGE: Performs from -80°C to 538°C. Use in engine bays, 
  exhaust systems, industrial ovens, and cryogenic applications where 
  plastic alternatives would fail.

• GTSE TRADE QUALITY: Family business with 13+ years supplying trade 
  professionals across construction, oil & gas, automotive, and marine 
  industries. 25,000+ SKUs in stock, next-day delivery available.
```

#### Reusable/Releasable Cable Ties - 5 Bullet Structure

```markdown
• REUSABLE DESIGN: Release tab allows easy removal and reuse. Perfect for 
  temporary installations, prototype work, event setups, and applications 
  where access is needed regularly.

• PROFESSIONAL GRADE NYLON 66: Same industrial-quality material as our 
  permanent ties. Temperature rated -40°C to 85°C. UV stabilized for 
  outdoor applications.

• SECURE HOLD WITH EASY RELEASE: Push-to-release mechanism holds firmly 
  under tension but opens cleanly when needed. No cutting required, 
  no damage to cables.

• COST-EFFECTIVE BUNDLING: Reuse multiple times instead of cutting and 
  wasting single-use ties. Ideal for cable management during testing, 
  audio-visual setups, and temporary bundling.

• GTSE QUALITY GUARANTEE: UK trade supplier trusted by electricians, 
  AV professionals, and contractors. Bulk packs available. Trade accounts 
  with 30-day terms for qualifying businesses.
