# Returns Management (RMA) Strategy

Returns are an opportunity to build loyalty.

## The Policy
*   **Standard**: 30 Days, No questions asked. Buyer pays return shipping unless defective.
*   **Defective**: We pay shipping. Immediate replacement sent.
*   **B2B**: Restocking fee (15%) may apply for massive bulk returns (preventing inventory dumping).

## Processing Flow
1.  **Request**: Customer fills out form on site.
2.  **Approval**: Agent reviews. Auto-approve if <$50.
3.  **Label**: System generates QR code label (No printer needed).
4.  **Inspection**: Warehouse checks condition.
    *   *Sellable*: Return to stock.
    *   *Damaged*: Write off / Recycle.
5.  **Refund**: Triggered immediately after inspection scan.

## Reducing Returns
*   **Better Data**: Most returns are "Wrong Size". Improve dimensions on PDP.
*   **Support**: Encourage "Chat with us" before buying if unsure about compatibility.
