# Workflow: Social Media Distribution

## Overview

This workflow repurposes long-form content into social media posts for X (Twitter) and LinkedIn.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Source content (blog post, article, etc.)
- [ ] Target platform(s)
- [ ] Key message to convey

## Steps

### 1. Extract

Identify the key points from the source content:
- Main argument or insight
- Surprising statistic or fact
- Actionable takeaway
- Memorable quote

### 2. Format

#### For X (Twitter)

**Single Tweet:**
- 280 characters max
- Hook in first 100 characters
- One key point
- Optional: thread for longer content

**Thread Structure:**
```
Tweet 1: Hook (problem or insight)
Tweet 2-4: Context and explanation
Tweet 5-7: Supporting points
Tweet 8: Conclusion + CTA
```

#### For LinkedIn

- 1,300 characters max (optimal: 150-300)
- Professional tone
- Line breaks for readability
- Hashtags at end (3-5 max)
- Tag relevant people/companies

### 3. Adapt Voice

**X:**
- Concise, punchy
- Can be more casual
- Use threads for depth

**LinkedIn:**
- Professional but approachable
- Focus on business value
- Invite discussion

Both follow 162 brand voice:
- British English
- No jargon
- Direct and honest

### 4. Create Variants

Create 2-3 versions for testing:

| Variant | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| A | Question hook |
| B | Statistic hook |
| C | Contrarian hook |

### 5. Output

Provide:
- Platform-optimised copy
- Suggested hashtags
- Best time to post (if known)
- Link to original content

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### X (Twitter)

**Format:**
```
[Hook statement]

[Supporting detail]

[CTA or insight]

#hashtag (optional)
```

**Example:**
```
Your AI is only as smart as the context you give it.

We've seen teams paste the same company description 
into ChatGPT 50 times a day.

There's a better way.

(Thread 🧵)
```

### LinkedIn

**Format:**
```
[Hook paragraph]

[Line break]

[Key insight]

[Line break]

[Supporting point]

[Line break]

[CTA]

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3
```

**Example:**
```
Most AI implementations fail for the same reason: 
context.

—

Your team pastes the same company description into 
ChatGPT ten times a day. They use different prompts. 
The output varies wildly.

—

We fix this with structured knowledge architecture.

Context → Workflows → Consistent Output

How are you handling AI consistency in your org?
