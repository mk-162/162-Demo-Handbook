**[CUSTOMIZE: All templates with your voice, products, and proof points]**

#### Template A: Introduction

```
Subject: [Company] + [Your Company] - quick question

Hi [First Name],

Noticed [Company] is in [industry] - we supply [product category] 
to [X similar companies] across the UK.

Quick question: who handles your [product category] purchasing? 
Would love to understand if there's a fit.

Not looking to pitch - just exploring if we can help with 
[common pain point: pricing / availability / quality / service].

[Your name]
[Title], [Company]
[Phone]

P.S. [One-liner proof point, e.g., "We process 3,000+ orders daily 
from our UK warehouse - most ship same day."]
```

#### Template C: Case Study

```
Subject: How [Similar Company] saved XX% on [product]

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my earlier note.

Quick example that might be relevant: [Similar Company] in [industry] 
switched to us last year. Results:

• [XX]% cost reduction on [product category]
• [X]-day delivery vs [X] weeks previously  
• Dedicated account manager (no call centers)

Would a 10-minute call be useful to explore if similar results 
are possible for [Company]?

[Calendar link]

[Your name]
```

#### Template F: Breakup

```
Subject: Closing your file

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about [product category] supply 
for [Company] - appreciate you're busy.

I'll close your file for now, but if supply or pricing becomes 
an issue with your current supplier, my door's open.

One thing we do differently: [unique value prop].

Wishing you and the team well.

[Your name]
```

### 2.3 Phone Scripts

**[CUSTOMIZE: Your phone approach]**

#### Script 1: Discovery Call

```
"Hi [Name], this is [You] from [Company]. 

I sent an email earlier this week about [product category] - 
did you happen to see it?

[IF YES] Great - was curious if it's something worth a conversation?

[IF NO] No problem - the short version: we supply [products] to 
[similar companies]. I was wondering who handles that purchasing 
for you and if there's ever frustration with [common pain point]?

[LISTEN - then qualify or book meeting]"
