# Website & Multi-Site Strategy

## The BigCommerce Multi-Storefront (MSF) Plan

### Structure
*   **Storefront 1: UK Main (`.co.uk`)**
    *   *Audience*: Consumers, SME, Tradespeople.
    *   *Focus*: Ease of use, VAT included, Fast Delivery.
*   **Storefront 2: US Trade (`.com`)**
    *   *Audience*: US B2B Buyers.
    *   *Focus*: Bulk options, Request a Quote, Net Terms info.

### Best Practices
*   **Shared Inventory**: Manage stock in one place (BigCommerce backend).
*   **Unique Content**: Do NOT copy-paste product descriptions between sites. Google will flag it. Rewrite the US descriptions to use US spelling (Color vs Colour) and Imperial measurements (Inches vs mm).
